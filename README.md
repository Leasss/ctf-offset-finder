# CTF Offset Finder

CTF Offset Finder is a Python script that utilizes pwntools to find the offset for CTF challenges in 32-bit binaries. It helps determine the precise location within a buffer where the program's execution flow can be controlled or redirected.

## Features

- Automatically calculates the offset for a target function in a 32-bit binary.
- Uses a cyclic pattern to trigger crashes and determine the offset.
- Supports both local and remote binary execution.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6 or above
- pwntools library (`pip install pwntools`)

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:

```shell
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/ctf-offset-finder.git
